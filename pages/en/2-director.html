    When you think of historic directors who have significantly influenced the world of cinema, <span
        class="green-value">Steven
        Spielberg</span> is a
    name that inevitably comes to mind. His impact on the industry is such that he could be compared to one of the
    characters in one of his films: the visionary <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#johnhammond"
        class="red-link"><span>John Hammond</span></a>, who sought to redefine
    the way we perceive
    and interact with animals. In
    Spielberg's cinematic career, there is a sort of parallel between his work and the “fictional <a
        href="/pages/en/3-movie.html" class="red-link"><span>Jurassic
            Park</span></a>”, where innovation
    and spectacle combine to create his entire fantastic filmic universe.

    He made his debut with <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#jaws" class="red-link"><span>Jaws</span></a>, the first
    blockbuster in history. From <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#closeencountersofthethirdkind"
        class="red-link"><span>Close Encounters of the Third
            Kind</span></a> to his latest <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#blockbuster"
        class="red-link"><span>blockbuster</span></a>, <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#readyplayerone"
        class="red-link"><span>Ready Player
            One</span></a>... Spielberg has constantly
    pushed back the boundaries of narrative and visual effects in his productions. His ability to create thrilling
    stories <b>that resonate with adults and children alike</b> brings to mind Hammond's dream of a park where visitors
    of all ages can marvel at live dinosaurs as if they were his first attraction, his flea circus. A world where the
    effects are so real you can almost “see and touch them”. His filmography is a testament to his ability to move with
    the times while maintaining his distinctive identity.

    Just as John Hammond's vision had its share of challenges, Spielberg's path to success has not been without
    obstacles. His ability to overcome adversity and continue to create films that captivate audiences reflects
    Hammond's unwavering commitment to his vision of a dinosaur themed theme park. <b>Spielberg is a successful
        Hammond</b>.
    Spielberg through his film has resurrected dinosaurs, breathed life into many genres and stories while evolving
    (Hollywood) cinema for generations to come, just as he did with his masterpiece.
