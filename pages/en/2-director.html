            <p>When you think of historic directors who have significantly influenced the world of cinema, <span
                    class="green-value">Steven
                    Spielberg</span> is a
                name that inevitably comes to mind. His impact on the industry is such that he could be compared to one
                of
                the
                characters in one of his films: the visionary <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#johnhammond"
                    class="red-link"><span>John Hammond</span></a>, who sought to redefine
                the way we perceive
                and interact with animals. In
                Spielberg's cinematic career, there is a sort of parallel between his work and the “fictional <a
                    href="/pages/en/3-movie.html" class="red-link"><span>Jurassic
                        Park</span></a>”, where innovation
                and spectacle combine to create his entire fantastic filmic universe.</p>
            <p class="article__text__alinea">He made his debut with <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#jaws" class="red-link"><span>Jaws</span></a>,
                the
                first
                blockbuster in history. From <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#closeencountersofthethirdkind"
                    class="red-link"><span>Close Encounters of the Third
                        Kind</span></a> to his latest <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#blockbuster"
                    class="red-link"><span>blockbuster</span></a>, <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#readyplayerone"
                    class="red-link"><span>Ready Player
                        One</span></a>... Spielberg has constantly
                pushed back the boundaries of narrative and visual effects in his productions. His ability to create
                thrilling
                stories <b>that resonate with adults and children alike</b> brings to mind Hammond's dream of a park
                where
                visitors
                of all ages can marvel at live dinosaurs as if they were his first attraction, his flea circus. A world
                where the
                effects are so real you can almost “see and touch them”. His filmography is a testament to his ability
                to
                move with
                the times while maintaining his distinctive identity.</p>

            <p class="article__text__alinea">Just as John Hammond's vision had its share of challenges, Spielberg's path to success has not been
                without
                obstacles. His ability to overcome adversity and continue to create films that captivate audiences
                reflects
                Hammond's unwavering commitment to his vision of a dinosaur themed theme park. <b>Spielberg is a
                    successful
                    Hammond</b>.
                Spielberg through his film has resurrected dinosaurs, breathed life into many genres and stories while
                evolving
                (Hollywood) cinema for generations to come, just as he did with his masterpiece.</p>
