    <span class="green-value">Palaeoart</span>, the fascinating way to depict ancient life

    The perfect marriage of Science and Art with a single aim: to create accurate prehistoric worlds

    It's not often that we see a fusion between fields that used to oppose each other. However, there is a union between
    two opposites, Art and Science, within a single discipline known as “<a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#palaeoart" class="red-link"><span>Palaeoart</span></a>”.
    <b>Palaeoart is
        an artistic creation in all possible forms</b> (digital illustration, painting, animation, CGI, sculpture,
    drawing, sound, etc.) <b>that aims to reconstruct</b> the anatomy, behaviour, habits, visuals and even sounds of
    <b>species that were once alive in ancient geological times</b>.
    It's no coincidence that our site is based on a <a href="/pages/en/1-characterline.html" class="red-link"><span>Jurassic Park line</span></a>, because just as
    life always finds a
    way, so does artistic creation, particularly in this field, which has evolved so much since its origins.

    By combining scientific accuracy with artistic creativity to reconstruct vanished worlds and species, palaeoartists
    are able to make tangible phenomena that our species has never experienced or that are too old to be clearly
    remembered (i.e. the <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#cenozoic" class="red-link"><span>Cenozoic</span></a>).

    <b>Palaeoartists are the architects of this remarkable union of two</b> normally irreconcilable domains. Their work
    involves meticulous research into ancient creatures, and while each has his or her own style, like all artists, most
    ensure that every detail is in line with what we already know and with the most recent, verified scientific
    discoveries. From the skeletal structure to the texture of the skin and the environment they
    inhabited(<a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#palaeoenvironment" class="red-link"><span>palaeoenvironment</span></a>), palaeoart captures the essence
    of this fascinating past that can still teach us so much about our present.

    This is an extremely meticulous process, often involving the examination of fossils, the study of comparative
    anatomy and consultation with palaeontologists to ensure the utmost accuracy. As was the case for <a href="/pages/en/3-movie.html" class="red-link"><span>Jurassic
        Park</span></a> with palaeontologist <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#jackhorner" class="red-link"><span>Jack Horner</span></a>.

    Paleoart is not just an artistic approach, it is also <b>an educational and teaching tool</b>. Indeed, without
    palaeoartists, it would have been impossible for us to visualise and hear on the various media the majestic
    creatures that once roamed our planet. This discipline also encourages a deeper and more fascinating understanding
    of palaeontology.

    With a common goal, palaeoart creates a unique and captivating interdisciplinary bridge between the fields of Art
    and Science.
