            It's not often that we see a fusion between fields that used to oppose each other. However, there is a
            union between
            two opposites, Art and Science, within a single discipline known as “<a
                href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#palaeoart" class="red-link"><span>Palaeoart</span></a>”.
            <b>Palaeoart is
                an artistic creation in all possible forms</b> (digital illustration, painting, animation, CGI,
            sculpture,
            drawing, sound, etc.) <b>that aims to reconstruct</b> the anatomy, behaviour, habits, visuals and even
            sounds of
            <b>species that were once alive in ancient geological times</b>.
            It's no coincidence that our site is based on a <a href="/pages/en/1-characterline.html"
                class="red-link"><span>Jurassic Park line</span></a>, because just as
            life always finds a
            way, so does artistic creation, particularly in this field, which has evolved so much since its origins.

            By combining scientific accuracy with artistic creativity to reconstruct vanished worlds and species,
            palaeoartists
            are able to make tangible phenomena that our species has never experienced or that are too old to be
            clearly
            remembered (i.e. the <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#cenozoic"
                class="red-link"><span>Cenozoic</span></a>).

                <b>Palaeoartists are the architects of this remarkable union of two</b> normally irreconcilable domains.
                Their work
                involves meticulous research into ancient creatures, and while each has his or her own style, like all
                artists, most
                ensure that every detail is in line with what we already know and with the most recent, verified
                scientific
                discoveries. From the skeletal structure to the texture of the skin and the environment they
                inhabited(<a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#palaeoenvironment"
                    class="red-link"><span>palaeoenvironment</span></a>), palaeoart captures the essence
                of this fascinating past that can still teach us so much about our present.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an extremely meticulous process, often involving the examination of fossils, the study of
                comparative
                anatomy and consultation with palaeontologists to ensure the utmost accuracy. As was the case for <a
                    href="/pages/en/3-movie.html" class="red-link"><span>Jurassic
                        Park</span></a> with palaeontologist <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#jackhorner"
                    class="red-link"><span>Jack Horner</span></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Palaeoart is not just an artistic approach, it is also <b>an educational and teaching tool</b>. Indeed,
                without
                palaeoartists, it would have been impossible for us to visualise and hear on the various media the
                majestic
                creatures that once roamed our planet. This discipline also encourages a deeper and more fascinating
                understanding
                of palaeontology.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a common goal, palaeoart creates a unique and captivating interdisciplinary bridge between the
                fields of Art
                and Science.
