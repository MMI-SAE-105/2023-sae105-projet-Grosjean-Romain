                In the world of film soundtrack composition and composer, <span class="green-value">John Williams</span>
                is an
                almost legendary figure.
                As well known as <a href="/pages/en/2-director.html" class="red-link"><span>Steven Spielberg</span></a>,
                the
                composer with his exceptional talent for
                creating unforgettable
                tunes, drastically contributes to and enriches the quality of masterpieces of the 7ᵉ art. These
                masterpieces
                include
                his work on <a href="/pages/en/3-movie.html" class="red-link"><span>Jurassic Park</span></a>, which
                gives even
                more consistency and life to the work as
                well as to the
                film park.
            </p>
            <p>
                These compositions have an
                unrivalled ability to convey strong impressions and emotions. They establish the atmosphere to fully
                immerse
                listeners in the cinematic experience being presented. His work on Jurassic Park is no exception. The
                musical
                construction creates a soundscape that sometimes reflects the greatness, the wonder and sometimes the
                primordial
                terror conveyed by the dinosaurs. This work should also be considered <b>in conjunction with that of the
                    film's
                    sound engineers</b>, who thought about the different noises and sounds produced by species that
                humans have
                never heard before. On this last point, I invite you to visit the “<a href="/pages/en/7-palaeoart.html"
                    class="red-link"><span>Palaeoart</span></a>” section
                to find out more.

                The harmonious melodies, punctuated by moments of suspense, mystery and a certain majesty that
                the
                creatures
                already
                convey through their strangeness and sometimes titanic size... give the viewer <b>the impression
                    of
                    being part
                    of
                    the adventure</b>, and of not only “seeing” but “hearing” everything that happens.
            </p>
            <p>
                A veritable aural treasure trove, John
                Williams masterfully captures the essence of the story, <b>giving the dinosaurs and their world
                    a
                    voice</b> that
                resonated through cinemas and even years after the film's release. His contribution to Jurassic
                Park is
                not just
                a
                soundtrack, it is an integral and essential part of what made the film such a critical success.
