    budget. The first film to stand out as a blockbuster was Jaws.

    Brachiosaurus:
    A Jurassic dinosaur, it is one of the largest and fattest land animals ever to walk the Earth. Unlike theropods,
    which include all bipedal dinosaurs (almost all predators) and our modern birds, brachiosaurs are sauropods. In
    other words, they were quadrupeds with vegetarian diets, small heads, long necks, massive bodies and long tails. In
    the case of the brachiosaurus, it could reach 25 metres in length, 12 metres and weighed up to 50 tonnes.

    Cenozoic:
    This is the geological era following the Mesozoic to the present day, and is particularly significant for the
    evolution of the class that corresponds to us, the mammals.

    Close Encounters of the Third Kind:
    Released in 1977, this Steven Spielberg film focuses on communication between humans and extraterrestrials.

    De-extinction:
    A concept in biology that aims to revive extinct species.

    Dinomania:
    Period from the early 90s to the late 2000s when a widespread fascination with dinosaurs and palaeontology emerged.

    Dino media:
    Simply a compound word, this refers to media closely associated with dinosaurs and prehistoric species.

    Dodo:
    A bird species closely related to pigeons, it is infamous for its extinction. Endemic to Mauritius, it became
    extinct less than a century after its discovery at the end of the 17th century.

    A character from the Jurassic Park universe, he is the chief scientist in charge of dinosaur genetics. The actor
    Bradley Darryl Wong plays the character on screen.

    first Jurassic Park film/novel takes place on this island.

    Jack Horner:
    Famous palaeontologist, best known for his groundbreaking discovery of the very first dinosaur nest (Maiasaura
    peeblesorum) with young still inside. He also contributed his knowledge as a consultant to the design of the
    dinosaurs for the very first Jurassic Park film, and also for Jurassic World concerning the fictional Indominus Rex
    species.

    Jaws:
    Steven Spielberg's famous 1975 film about a small seaside resort on the east coast of the US that overnight becomes
    the bloody home of a great white shark.

    Attenborough in the film.

    A genus of the Elephantidae family, most people think of the Woolly Mammoth. It is a highly iconic extinct mammal
    with a strong resemblance to modern-day elephants, the only difference being its thick coat of fur. It is one of the
    best-studied and understood prehistoric animals, thanks to the large number of remains of the species imprisoned in
    the ice (Alaska, Siberia).

    Mesozoic:
    A geological era often referred to as the “age of the dinosaurs”. It comprises three periods that are well known to
    the general public: the Triassic, the Jurassic and the Cretaceous.

    Tyrannosaurus:
    One of the most iconic dinosaur, it is the best-known species of the Dinosauria clade. It features almost everywhere
    in pop culture, so it's hard not to have an idea of what it looks like.

    Velociraptor/Raptor:
    A dinosaur from the Dromeosauridae family, the best-known species Velociraptor mongoliensis comes not from North
    America (where most of the species featured in Jurassic Park originated), but from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia
