                A film with great commercial and popular success, which in the vast majority of cases has benefited from

            <dd>
                A Jurassic dinosaur, it is one of the largest and fattest land animals ever to walk the Earth. Unlike
                theropods, which include all bipedal dinosaurs (almost all predators) and our modern birds, brachiosaurs
                are
                sauropods. In other words, they were quadrupeds with vegetarian diets, small heads, long necks, massive
                bodies and long tails. In the case of the brachiosaurus, it could reach 25 metres in length, 12 metres
                and
                weighed up to 50 tonnes.
