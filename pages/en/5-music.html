    The musical compositions in a film have the power to evoke a billion different emotions, whether to create tension
    or a moment of calm within the narrative. In Jurassic Park, <a href="/pages/en/6-composer.html" class="red-link"><span>John
            Williams</span></a>' iconic score manages to do
    just that. The film's music, closely linked to the famous line - it should be noted that one of the soundtracks also
    bears the same name as our line “<a href="/pages/en/1-characterline.html" class="red-link"><span>Life finds a way</span></a>” - also adds depth to
    the story.

    <b>An enigmatic, menacing melody</b>, which plays a discreet role in the film, but is
    also full of meaning. This John Williams composition reinforces both the sense of wonder and danger in the film,
    accompanying <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#drianmalcolm" class="red-link"><span>Malcolm'</span></a>s words about the unpredictability of life itself.
    <b>Foreshadowing the plot</b>
    by creating this tension within our protagonists, it can be heard when <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#professorgrant" class="red-link"><span>Professor
        Grant</span></a> and the children
    discover <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#velociraptor" class="red-link"><span>velociraptor</span></a> eggs in the park on their own. The scene is
    at first magical, symbolising the
    miracle of life, then threatening... Since raptors are presented in the film as being more dangerous than the
    <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#tyrannosaurus" class="red-link"><span>T-Rex</span></a> because they are more intelligent, it's best to flee, and very
    quickly!

    In any case, this unforgettable melody reminds us that life is both tenacious and unpredictable.
    Just as the dinosaurs found a way to transcend genetic control, this timeless composition continues to resonate with
    the viewer, as it does with us.
