            <p>In <a href="/pages/en/2-director.html" class="red-link"><span>Steven Spielberg</span></a>'s 1993 film <a
                    href="/pages/en/3-movie.html" class="red-link"><span>Jurassic Park</span></a>, the
                character of <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#drianmalcolm" class="red-link"><span>Dr. Ian
                        Malcolm</span></a>
                utters a line that has become emblematic: “<span class="green-value">Life finds a way</span>”. Although
                the
                line
                was not originally spoken in exactly this way, it is this simplification that has stood the test of time
                and
                resonates in viewers' memories. In itself, it sums up the very essence of the film from which it is
                taken.
                But
                what
                are these meanings?</p>
            <p class="article__text__alinea">First of all, it appears during a discussion that takes place in the incubator room. The subject of the
                discussion is the park's dinosaurs, and more specifically their reproduction. <a
                    href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#johnhammond" class="red-link"><span>Hammond</span></a>, the
                visionary
                behind the park, claims that they have genetically modified all the dinosaurs on the island to be
                exclusively
                female
                so that they are
                sterile and can never reproduce in the wild, without human control. Dr. Malcolm asks a question that's a
                bit
                hard-hitting: “But again, how do you know they're all female? Does somebody go out into the park and
                pull up
                the
                dinosaurs'
                skirts?” This remark, though expressed in the character's own humorous tone, touches on a deep theme of
                Jurassic
                Park, which
                is: <b>the illusion of control</b>.</p>

                and Hammond think they have dominated nature, but Malcolm reminds them
                that nature,
                despite all efforts to control it, always finds a way to express itself. It is unpredictable and defies
                our
                attempts
                to contain it. In essence, the quote emphasises this <b>central key theme of the film and the saga</b>,
                the
                consequences of
                human arrogance and our attempts to manipulate the natural world by playing God.</p>
            <p class="article__text__alinea">Although it may seem like an easy phrase, it carries an extremely profound philosophical message. It
                warns
                us by
                symbolising the struggle between human hubris and the indomitable forces of nature. In a way, it reminds
                us
                that,
                even now, it is <b>vitally important to respect and preserve our natural environmen</b>t to avoid
                further
                tragedies.</p>
