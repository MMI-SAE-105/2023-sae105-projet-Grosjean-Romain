    About the project

    The project consisted of building a website with the mobile version as a priority, in other words, it had to be
    designed to be consulted on a smartphone. The most interesting part of this project, and therefore of the site, is
    that it will be based around a more or less famous line from a film. This same line will be the backbone for all the
    site's content (textual, visual, thematic, etc.).

    It will also be available in both French and English in order to reach a wider
    audience (as well as sometimes corresponding to the very identity of our site/character line). Still in the
    guidelines,
    the home page should show to anyone the main articles, information on the chosen line (“Life finds a way”), details
    of
    the film from which it is taken, the film's director, a book associated with this line (this could be the original
    work
    that was adapted into a film or a book on a related theme), and finally a music that is also linked to this line.

    In
    addition to these main articles, the website need to offer other content. It is now possible to explore a list of
    books
    linked to the line in the form of a frieze, to view a gallery of films still linked to the line, to watch an extract
    or
    a trailer from the film, or to find a form to fill in in the contact section to get in touch with the site's author
    (myself).

    The aim was also to make the site environmentally friendly by getting an 'A' rating on ecoindex.fr, as
    we've
    already mentioned above. On top of all that, we had to equip ourselves with a language model (LLM), artificial
    intelligence, in order to generate content that was a little different and unique. We also had to explain how the
    keywords were chosen, the tricks used, the corrections made, the results obtained, and so on.

    To sum up, the aim of
    this project was to create a website that was both fun and informative, based around a line from a film that spoke
    to
    us. And finally, with all these elements, we obviously had to follow the best practices when it came to managing
    this
    project.
