                About the project
            </h1>
            <p>
                The project consisted of building a website with the mobile version as a priority, in other words, it
                had to
                be
                designed to be consulted on a smartphone. The most interesting part of this project, and therefore of
                the
                site,
                is
                that it will be based around a more or less famous line from a film. This same line will be the backbone
                for
                all
                the
                site's content (textual, visual, thematic, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
                It will also be available in both French and English in order to reach a wider
                audience (as well as sometimes corresponding to the very identity of our site/character line). Still in
                the
                guidelines, the home page should show to anyone the main articles, information on the chosen line
                (“<b>Life
                    finds a
                    way</b>”), details of the film from which it is taken, the film's director, a book associated with
                this
                line
                (this could be the original work that was adapted into a film or a book on a related theme), and finally
                a
                music
                that is also linked to this line.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to these main articles, the website need to offer other content. It is now possible to
                explore a
                list of
                books linked to the line in the form of a frieze, to view a gallery of films still linked to the line,
                to
                watch
                an
                extract or a trailer from the film, or to find a form to fill in in the contact section to get in touch
                with
                the
                site's author (myself).
            </p>
            <p>
                The aim was also to make the site environmentally friendly by getting an 'A' rating on ecoindex.fr, as
                we've already mentioned above. On top of all that, we had to equip ourselves with a language model
                (LLM),
                artificial
                intelligence, in order to generate content that was a little different and unique. We also had to
                explain
                how
                the
                keywords were chosen, the tricks used, the corrections made, the results obtained, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                To sum up, the aim of this project was to create a website that was both fun and informative, based
                around a
                line
                from a film that spoke to us. And finally, with all these elements, we obviously had to follow the best
                practices
                when it came to managing this project.

                assure
                you!
                All joking aside, I'm
                currently 21 years old and, having passed my Bac L, done my civic service and spent two years in
                preparatory
                classes
                CPGE Lettres, I'm now studying for a BUT MMI (Multimedia and Internet Professions) in Montbéliard.

                Lover
                of
                extinct
                species since I was a child, and a graphic designer in my spare time, I started this project based on a
                famous
                line
                of one of my favourite films, Jurassic Park.
            </p>
            <p>
                The line chosen was “<b>Life always finds a way</b>” spoken
                by
                the
                character of Dr. Ian Malcolm played by the actor Jeff Goldblum himself.

                So, with my website, I invite
                you to
                explore
                with me all that's around this line, to learn new things about Jurassic Park and palaeontology and to
                discover
                what
                is palaeoart, which is still too little known in France.
