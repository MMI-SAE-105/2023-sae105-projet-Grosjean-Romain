                    class="red-link"><span>Steven Spielberg</span></a>, is
                nothing less than a cinematic masterpiece
                that continues to inspire imaginations the world over. Released in 1993, it was this very film that
                redefined our
                perception of dinosaurs by making them a part of popular culture. In a way, it became a cultural
                landmark,
                pioneering “<a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#dinomania" class="red-link"><span>Dinomania</span></a>”
                and a
                significant
                event for “<a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#palaeoart" class="red-link"><span>Palaeoart</span></a>”.
            </p>
            <p class="article__text__alinea">The film recounts the vision of one man, <a
                    href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#johnhammond" class="red-link"><span>John Hammond</span></a>, an
                ambitious entrepreneur who
                succeeds in
                bringing dinosaurs back to life and opens an amusement park on a remote
                island. From an impressive first face-to-face encounter with a giant <a
                    href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#brachiosaurus" class="red-link"><span>brachiosaurus</span></a> to
                a breathless
                escape from a pack of <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#velociraptor"
                    class="red-link"><span>velociraptors</span></a>, Jurassic Park plunges viewers into a world where
                these ancient
                creatures once again walk the Earth alongside us. The
                film's revolutionary special effects were groundbreaking for their time and left audiences speechless.
                The
                combination of digital effects (CGI) and physical effects (animatronics, robots, puppets) and the
                experience that
                <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#philtippett" class="red-link"><span>Phil Tippet</span></a> brought
                to the film
                made it an extremely convincing experience for its
                time:
            </p>
            <p>“John Hammond, CEO of <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#ingen" class="red-link"><span>InGen</span></a>,
                turns
                science into entertainment by bringing real
                dinosaurs back to life
                in a giant amusement park on the island of <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#islanublar"
                    class="red-link"><span>Isla Nublar</span></a>. In the middle of a tropical
                storm,
                a computer sabotage releases all the creatures in the park, and the dream turns rapidly into a
                nightmare, as a group
                of visitors are forced to fight for their survival on the now dinosaur-infested island.”

            <p class="article__text__alinea">In the end, what really sets Jurassic Park apart is its ability to evoke
                the wonder of seeing real,
                living dinosaurs
                that you could almost “see”. Combine talent, quality effects and thrilling action with real scientific
                and ethical
                dilemmas and you have a great film. As <a href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#drianmalcolm"
                    class="red-link"><span>Malcolm</span></a> describes in the film
                with his chaos
                theory,
                highlighting the dangers of playing with nature and the fact that everything can tip at any moment, this
                balance can
                be found in the film itself. Indeed, <b>it is this delicate balance between the miraculous and the
                    threatening</b>
                that makes Jurassic Park not only a film about dinosaurs, clearly inscribed, along with the BBC's <a

                        Dinosaurs</span></a>
                series in 1999, as the founder of the “Dinomania” of
                the 90s through to the end of the 2000s.

            <p class="article__text__alinea">But JP's influence extends far beyond the screen... A global cultural
                phenomenon still
                unrivalled in the field, he rekindled the public's fascination with dinosaurs and led to a resurgence of
                interest in
                palaeontology and indeed palaeoart, spawning a new era of scientific and artistic exploration and
                experimentation.
                Dinosaurs became so popular that they are still a source of inspiration for artists, scientists and
                film-makers
                today, <b>so much so that it is difficult to detach oneself from the archetypes and clichés that the
                    saga
                    brought.</b>
            </p>
            <p class="article__text__alinea">In any case, if species from the <a
                    href="/pages/en/11-glossary.html#mesozoic" class="red-link"><span>Mesozoic</span></a> era once again
                reigned on Earth for the
                duration of a
                session, Jurassic Park was also the
                creator of a world where these majestic creatures reign supreme indefinitely in our imagination.
