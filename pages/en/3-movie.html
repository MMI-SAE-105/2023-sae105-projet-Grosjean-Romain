    <span>Jurassic Park</span>, directed by <span>Steven Spielberg</span>, is nothing less than a cinematic masterpiece
    that continues to inspire imaginations the world over. Released in 1993, it was this very film that redefined our
    perception of dinosaurs by making them a part of popular culture. In a way, it became a cultural landmark,
    pioneering “<span>Dinomania</span>” and a significant
    event for “<span>Palaeoart</span>”.

    The film recounts the vision of one man, <span>John Hammond</span>, an ambitious entrepreneur who succeeds in
    bringing dinosaurs back to life and opens an amusement park on a remote
    island. From an impressive first face-to-face encounter with a giant <span>Brachiosaurus</span> to a breathless
    escape from a pack of <span>Velociraptors</span>, Jurassic Park plunges viewers into a world where these ancient
    creatures once again walk the Earth alongside us. The
    film's revolutionary special effects were groundbreaking for their time and left audiences speechless. The
    combination of digital effects (CGI) and physical effects (animatronics, robots, puppets) and the experience that
    <span>Phil Tippet</span> brought to the film made it an extremely convincing experience for its time:

    “John Hammond, CEO of <span>InGen</span>, turns science into entertainment by bringing real dinosaurs back to life
    in a giant amusement park on the island of <span>Isla Nublar</span>. In the middle of a tropical storm,
    a computer sabotage releases all the creatures in the park, and the dream turns rapidly into a nightmare, as a group
    of visitors are forced to fight for their survival on the now dinosaur-infested island.”

    In the end, what really sets Jurassic Park apart is its ability to evoke the wonder of seeing real, living dinosaurs
    that you could almost “see”. Combine talent, quality effects and thrilling action with real scientific and ethical
    dilemmas and you have a great film. As <span>Malcolm</span> describes in the film with his chaos theory,
    highlighting the dangers of playing with nature and the fact that everything can tip at any moment, this balance can
    be found in the film itself. Indeed, <b>it is this delicate balance between the miraculous and the threatening</b>
    that makes Jurassic Park not only a film about dinosaurs, clearly inscribed, along with the BBC's <span>Walking with
        Dinosaurs</span> series in 1999, as the founder of the “Dinomania” of the 90s through to the end of the 2000s.

    But JP's influence extends far beyond the screen... A global cultural phenomenon still
    unrivalled in the field, he rekindled the public's fascination with dinosaurs and led to a resurgence of interest in
    palaeontology and indeed palaeoart, spawning a new era of scientific and artistic exploration and experimentation.
    Dinosaurs became so popular that they are still a source of inspiration for artists, scientists and film-makers
    today, <b>so much so that it is difficult to detach oneself from the archetypes and clichés that the saga
        brought.</b>

    In any case, if species from the <span>Mesozoic</span> era once again reigned on Earth for the duration of a
    session, Jurassic Park was also the
    creator of a world where these majestic creatures reign supreme indefinitely in our imagination.
