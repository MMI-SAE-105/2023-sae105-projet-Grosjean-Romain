                scientific
                curiosity and imagination. It offers a fascinating
                glimpse into the resurrection of
                long-extinct species through the wonders of genetic engineering. But <b>how close does the science of

                    come
                    to reality</b>, and what does it really take to bring back to life species that disappeared from the
                face of
                the
                Earth thousands or even millions of years ago?

            <p class="article__text__alinea">In the book <span class="green-value">The Science of Jurassic Park and The Lost World: How to Make a
                    Dinosaur</span>, American authors and researchers <b>David Lindley and Rob DeSalle</b> explore the
                scientific
                aspects
                of the film and the wider world of dinosaur recreation. They address essential questions about the
                possibility
                of
                resurrecting extinct species, and ultimately explore the real science behind the fiction.

            <p class="article__text__alinea">As far as Jurassic Park is concerned, it's true that the film presents a captivating portrait,
                albeit
                a
                fictional
                one, and with hindsight biased in many respects, of the cloning of dinosaurs from DNA preserved
                in
                the
                blood
                collected from mosquitoes and eventually trapped in amber. In reality, this process is far more
                complex
                and it
                is
                impossible to recover dinosaur DNA or even anything else in this way. We have a better chance of
                recovering the
                DNA
                of the mosquito itself in this way, and even then!

                The book raises profound questions about the ethics and implications of <a

                plunges
                us
                into the role of science, human ambition and commercial interests in the pursuit of
                “resurrected”
                species. Is it

                book
                serves
                as a
                bridge between
                cinematic spectacle and the fascinating world of science, offering us readers
                a better understanding of the film's themes and the ongoing efforts to unravel the mysteries of
                our
                prehistoric
                past.
