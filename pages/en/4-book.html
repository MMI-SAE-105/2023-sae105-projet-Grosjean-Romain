    <span>Jurassic Park</span>is a film that sparks scientific curiosity and imagination. It offers a fascinating
    glimpse into the resurrection of
    long-extinct species through the wonders of genetic engineering. But <b>how close does the science of the film come
        to reality</b>, and what does it really take to bring back to life species that disappeared from the face of the
    Earth thousands or even millions of years ago?

    In the book <span>The Science of Jurassic Park and The Lost World: How to Make a
        Dinosaur</span>, American authors and researchers <b>David Lindley and Rob DeSalle</b> explore the scientific
    aspects
    of the film and the wider world of dinosaur recreation. They address essential questions about the possibility of
    resurrecting extinct species, and ultimately explore the real science behind the fiction.

    As far as Jurassic Park is concerned, it's true that the film presents a captivating portrait, albeit a fictional
    one, and with hindsight biased in many respects, of the cloning of dinosaurs from DNA preserved in the blood
    collected from mosquitoes and eventually trapped in amber. In reality, this process is far more complex and it is
    impossible to recover dinosaur DNA or even anything else in this way. We have a better chance of recovering the DNA
    of the mosquito itself in this way, and even then!

    The book raises profound questions about the ethics and implications of <span>de-extinction</span>, and plunges us
    into the role of science, human ambition and commercial interests in the pursuit of “resurrected” species. Is it
    worth it to reviving the <span>Dodo</span> or the <span>Mammoths</span>? The book serves as a bridge between
    cinematic spectacle and the fascinating world of science, offering us readers
    a better understanding of the film's themes and the ongoing efforts to unravel the mysteries of our prehistoric
    past.
